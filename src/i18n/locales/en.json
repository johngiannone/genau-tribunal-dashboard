    "faq1Question": "Which AI models are included?",
    "faq1Answer": "By default, your council includes GPT-4o (The Chairman), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (The Critic), Qwen 2.5 Coder (The Architect), Grok 2 (The Reporter), and Llama 3.3 (The Speedster). You can customize this lineup by selecting from 330+ models including Gemini, Mistral, DeepSeek, and more.",
    "faq2Question": "How accurate is the consensus?",
    "faq2Answer": "Our multi-model consensus approach achieves 99% average confidence scores. By running multiple AI systems in parallel and having an auditor review their responses, we eliminate single-model hallucinations and biases. The synthesis only presents findings where models agree, ensuring high reliability.",
    "faq3Question": "Can I customize my council?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes! Navigate to Settings → Council to customize all five council slots. Choose from 330+ models based on your needs—whether you prioritize speed, creativity, coding ability, or cost efficiency. You can even swap models mid-conversation.",
    "faq4Question": "What's the difference between Free and Pro plans?",
    "faq4Answer": "Free Observer accounts get 3 audits per month to try the system. Pro Professional ($29/mo) unlocks 200 audits and 50 file uploads monthly. Max Power User ($99/mo) includes 800 audits, unlimited files, and 2M token context windows for large document analysis.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I upload documents for analysis?",
    "faq5Answer": "Absolutely. Upload PDFs, images, or documents directly in the chat interface. The Librarian (Gemini) will analyze your file and create context that persists across the entire conversation. All council members will reference this context when answering your questions.",
    "faq6Question": "How fast are the responses?",
    "faq6Answer": "Most audits complete in under 2 seconds. Because all models run in parallel rather than sequentially, you get the benefit of multiple AI perspectives without the wait. Response times vary based on which models you've selected—faster models like Llama deliver near-instant results.",
